 * The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using  @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan with 
 * their default attributes: [...].<br>
 * If specific packages are not defined, scanning will occur from the package of 
 * the class that declares this annotation.
 * If you want a custom configuration, provide your own @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan, as appropriate.
